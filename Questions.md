### Do you have experience working on Hasura as well? ###
Yes. I have previously worked on Hasura BaaS. But limited knowledge of GraphQL. 

# 1. Can you talk about a time when you’ve solved a difficult problem and talk us through the process you went through to solve it? #

Actually there was a working project - Resume Maker that was deployed on Internal Server on Ubuntu and we have to move it to AWS CentOS. The project in itself was complex and depends on native system dependency like phantomjs for html to pdf/image and imagemagick for watermarking. I was not having any previous knowledge of project. But I try my best and fix the issues and make it running by changing node library and code. 

# 2. Can you describe a time where you took responsibility for a project or long-term task and followed it through til the end? How did you find the process and how did you go about it? #

Yes. In project - Mechademy, I was in Backend Team but there was urgent requirement of Python Developer with knowledge of existing flow to write lambdas on AWS. I took it as an opportunity and brushed up my basics to deliever the required module. 

# 3. Can you talk about a project you worked on that went really well, and why it went so well? #

For good grace, All my projects are working well. But here I can discussed one of the node_modules - LibPay I am developing and is currently used in more than one project TeleMedicine and Qlinica. Currently it is supporting HyperPay and Stripe Payment Gateway Integration. Soon I will integrate PayTm. 

# 4. Can you talk about a project you worked on that maybe didn’t go so well, and what would you do differently if you were to do it again? #

Currently I do not have any project that didn't go well. And hope in future too will not have one. 

# 5. What your understanding of functional programming vs object oriented programming, and what are the pros and cons of each? #

I prefer object oriented programming over functional programming.

* Better readability.
* Code reuse by Inheritance.
* Encapsulation of code.
* Abstraction and polymorphism.

# 6. What are some steps you would take to ensure your code is secure? #

We can ensure code security at server by Obfuscating Code and Encrypting Env keys.

# 7. Where do you get your tech news from, what blogs or newsletters do you follow? #

Mainly, I follow docs and blogs. But sometime Medium, freeCodeCamp, hackr.io, dev.to are too useful. Last but not least, StackOverflow. 

# 8. What was the last technical book you read? #

Last technical book I have read was of Operating System - Galvin and Intro. to Algo. - Cormen during my college days. But I am very good at reading and prefer to read docs over book.

# 9. What makes a good engineer? #

I think creativity and can visualise. 

# 10. Do you have any experience with GraphQL if so, what benefits does it give you over a traditional REST api? #

I have very limited knowledge of GraphQL, so I can not compared both. Need to study.

# 11. What's your favourite recent feature in NodeJS? #

I like stream, and events. They are heart of Node. If I have to talk about New features Async and await is also good and provide better readability of code in compare to promises. I am waiting for import / export support in node.

# 12. If you were to design an API for a company, where would you start and what questions would you ask? #

Developing API is very easy task. So I will start with usecases.

* If frequent use is required can go with microservices architecture.
* If heavy loading is required can go with serverless architecture.
* If normal usecases is required can go with monolithic architecture.

# 13. What would your decisions making process be when choosing a database for a new service or product? #

- First and foremost question would be is Structure or Unstructure Data ? 
- Second would be frequent read or write?

* If there is need of joins I would love to go with SQL DB like postgreSQL.
* If only dumping is required would prefer NOSQL DB like mongoDB.
* If caching is required can use InMemory like redis.
* If real time is required can go with firebase.

# 14. What's your level of experience using a cloud provider, such as Google Cloud, Azure or AWS? #

To be very honest, I have use AWS services like S3, SQS, EC2, Lambda, MongoDB, RDS, ElasticCache, etc and can setup node server at EC2. If you see as Developer it is preety good but if you compare with devops need to work hard.

# 15. How would you go about scaling an API? #  

I am little bit confuse with questiom and answering what I think you mean.

There are 3 types of scaling:
* Dynamic Scaling
* Vertical Scaling 
* Horizontal Scaling

We can run our application in clustering and can go with Dynamic scaling (scale up when required) like Kubernetes.
